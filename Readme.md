# Building

Binaries are available in the `/bin` folder, but for developers, building from source might be useful.

This project uses [`spasm-ng`](https://github.com/alberthdev/spasm-ng) to compile, and I use Linux. I'll be honest, I don't know how well these instructions will work on Mac or Windows.

From the command line, run `./compile`

This generates the jump table and compiles the app and Grammer package.
